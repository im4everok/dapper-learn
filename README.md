# Learning Dapper in C#

Welcome to the "Learning Dapper in C#" project! This project serves as a practical learning experience for mastering Dapper, a simple and efficient micro-ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for .NET, in the context of C# development.

## Overview

Dapper is a lightweight and high-performance micro-ORM developed by Stack Exchange. It provides a simple and efficient way to work with databases in .NET applications, allowing developers to write raw SQL queries while providing convenient mapping between database results and C# objects.

In this project, i learned how to:

- Set up and configure Dapper in a C# project.
- Write and execute raw SQL queries using Dapper's query methods.
- Map query results to C# objects, including simple entities and complex relationships.
- Utilize C# LINQ methods in conjunction with Dapper for enhanced querying and data manipulation.

## Features

- **Dapper Integration**: Learn how to integrate Dapper into your C# project and leverage its capabilities for database access.
- **Raw SQL Queries**: Write raw SQL queries directly using Dapper's query methods, allowing for fine-grained control and optimization.
- **Object Mapping**: Utilize Dapper's automatic object mapping capabilities to map query results to C# objects effortlessly.
- **Relationship Mapping**: Learn how to handle complex relationships, including one-to-one and one-to-many, between database tables using Dapper.
- **LINQ Integration**: Explore the integration of Dapper with C# LINQ methods to build powerful and expressive queries.
